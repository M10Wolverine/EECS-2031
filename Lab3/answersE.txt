Breakpoint 1
display mainA = 1
display mainB = 20000

Breakpoint2
display x = 1
display y = 20000
display mainA = No symbol "mainA" in current context
display mainB = No symbol "mainB" in current context
(This is because variables mainA and mainB don't exist in the method; their values are passed to temporary variables x and y)

Breakpoint3
display x = 20000
display y = 1

Breakpoint 4
display mainA = 1
display mainB = 20000
display x = No symbol "x" in current context
display y = No symbol "y" in current context
(Values of x, y were swapped and returned to mainA, mainB. These temporary variables are then destroyed and no longer in context)
